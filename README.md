### Bubble Sort

This program demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm, which repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements to sort an array in ascending order. It's a simple and intuitive sorting technique ideal for small datasets.

### Binary Search

This program demonstrates a simple and efficient Binary Search algorithm. Just provide a sorted array and a number to find – the code will quickly tell you if it’s there and where! Perfect for beginners exploring algorithms in C++.

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element, moving the boundary between sorted and unsorted parts one step forward until the entire array is sorted.

# 🚀 Merge Sort – Divide, Conquer, and Sort!

Merge Sort is a **recursive** sorting algorithm that follows the **divide and conquer** strategy. It breaks an array into two halves, sorts them separately, and merges them back in sorted order.  

### 🌟 Why Use Merge Sort?
✅ **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (better than O(n²) sorting algorithms)  
✅ **Stable Sorting:** Maintains the relative order of equal elements  
✅ **Efficient for Large Data:** Works well with linked lists and external sorting  

### 🔍 How It Works
1️⃣ **Divide:** Split the array into two halves until each half has only one element.  
2️⃣ **Conquer:** Recursively sort both halves.  
3️⃣ **Merge:** Combine the sorted halves to form a sorted array.
